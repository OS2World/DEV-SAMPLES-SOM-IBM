Base Classes and Frameworks

Installation on OS/2

  These parts use the Component Install Utility that is part of PartMeister
  beta 6 and later. If you have not installed PartMeister, install it
  first, or follow the instructions for installation on Windows.

    type CINSTALL JMBASE.INS
    Fill in the directories requested and press Install.

Installation on Windows

  The CINSTALL program has not been ported to Windows yet, so the install
  process must be done manually. PartMeister for Windows has the templates
  installed as part of its install, so these may be deleted from the
  distribution package (DEL BASENC*.T* - remember the .T).

  Make a directory for the base parts, and copy all the files to that
  directory, for example

    MD \BASEPART
    CD \BASEPART
    MD JMBASE
    CD JMBASE
    COPY \TEMP\*.*

  Make a directory named PUBLIC to hold shared files

    MD \BASEPART\PUBLIC

  No files need to be copied to the public directory, it will be populated
  when the base classes are created using the make utility.


Building the base classes

  The makefile is initially set up for no debugging and an OS/2 deliverable.
  These two settings may be changed at the top of the makefile, along with
  the directories used in the build process. Check these settings, then
  run nmake or make to build the parts (IBM NMAKE on OS/2, IBM NMAKE on
  Windows and Opus MAKE on Windows have been tested).


Documentation

  Documentation is provided in the BASENC.HTM file (this file is in HTML
  format and may be viewed by loading it into any Web browser or HTML
  viewer).
