The samples under this directory illustrate simple usage of facilities provided
by the som.dll and the SOM Toolkit emitters for C and C++.

Each leaf subdirectory under this directory contains a sample, and makefiles
 corresponding to the following different C/C++ compilers: CSet++,
IBM Visual Age, Metaware HC, Borland, and Watcom.

The makefiles for the non-IBM compilers use the following environment variables
to provide the top level file system location of the corresponding compiler.
Before running the makefile for these compilers, the corresponding environment
variable should be set.

Metaware: HCDIR
Borland:  BCCDIR
Watcom:   WCDIR

Except for the Watcom makefile, the makefiles have been tested using the IBM 
nmake program. The Watcom makefile requires use of Watcom's wmake program.on
